## What is Survivor League?

Survivor League is a processing (Java) based game in which you are a fish in a virtual aquarium and need to survive by avoiding fish larger than you while still growing in size to eventually become the apex predator in the virtual aquarium.

Currently in the game, we have 3 different difficultys:
